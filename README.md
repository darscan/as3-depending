=============

The term *dependency injection* is a very generel one, so I will define what I mean when talking about this subject:

1. depending classes **communicate** their dependencies
2. **deciding how to resolve** dependencies (e.g. what kind of instance to use that implements the required interface)
3. using those decision(s) to **create** instances with **resolved** dependencies


All object oriented application code I know has classes that depend on other classes, so I claim that they all use dependency injection, if understood the way described above.


*work in progress*
